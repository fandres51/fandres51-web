In this section, I will talk about the design of the webpage you are seeing right now.

## UX Design

The objective of the web page was to grow up my branch. Some designs were created:

### a. Wireframes

In this early stage of the project, a Mobile First solution where designed.

### b. First Design

Next, the webpage where designed, taking into count the colors and fonts to be used. This version 
of the landing page was uploaded to the internet.

### c. Current Design

A second and uploaded version of the page was created by adding new features and fixing some problems.
The main changes were:

- The banner picture is now more striking on laptops.
- Support for big and 4k screens.
- New section to include some of my work.
- New portfolio section.
- Lots of responsive problems were fixed.
- The footer section is now more striking and simple.

As in every software project, this is NOT the final version and will keep growing over time.
