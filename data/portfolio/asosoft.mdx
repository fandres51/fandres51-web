AsoSoft is a project created in 2020 by me and my partner Ernesto to 
create a management system for the Systems Engineer Council. This also worked
as the final project of my career.

You can check out this project on [Github](https://github.com/fandres51/proyectointegrador-enriquez-yaselga)

    Hi, I am a software engineer who got caught in marketing and creativity after being graduated. 
    As my formation was, I love technology, so I try to combine the best of coding, user experience design and digital marketing in my work.
    If you need a job related to any of those areas, get in touch with me so we can talk.
