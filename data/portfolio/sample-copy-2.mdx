## A simple example of Markdown

This is a paragraph of text written in Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It can be used to format text, create lists, add links, and much more.

Here is a section of code written in Python:

```python
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("John")
```

This code will output:

```
Hello, John!
```

That's it for my Markdown sample!
